PBDB/Neotoma Composite API - deduplication detection 

#### Project Goals
- Create Time translation between YBP ("years before present") and MA/MYA ("millions of years ago") so data can be compared on same scale
- Determine factors for what qualifies as a duplicate occurrence between PBDB and Neotoma
