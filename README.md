PBDB/Neotoma Composite API - deduplication detection 

#### Project Goals
- Create Time translation between YBP ("years before present [Jan 1 1950]") and MA/MYA ("millions of years ago") so data can be compared on same scale
-- Neotoma time ranges should fit inside PBDB time ranges


- Determine factors for what qualifies as a duplicate occurrence between PBDB and Neotoma
